At current stage, we have implemented unit3's requirement including supporting different screen size, dividing into different package and creating interface. Especially, we primarily focus on webservice backend design (servlet) and mysql database design. Although some of functions interacted with backend database haven't been fully implemented. However, now consumer and retailer can sign up an account and data will be stored into our backend database. Then, user can log in with personal username and password. This demonstrates our web service can work well with our android device.
