At unit4 stage, we try to implement more difficult part such as retailer can upload item's picture to remote database and user can also search the item by ketwords from the remote database and return search result. However, we are still debuging these parts and haven't finished it. After completing this part, retailer can use add item function to add anything into database.

The other thing is we have slightly changed the table schema because we have found we can use String type to store image information via JSON encoding and decoding. Moreover, for the user and retailer's password colum, we have used MySQL built-in function to encode and decode the information.
